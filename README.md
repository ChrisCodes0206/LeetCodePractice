# LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode Journey repository! This repository serves as a log of my journey learning and practicing LeetCode problems and related coding principles. My goal is to sharpen my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures, and prepare for coding interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders based on topics, problem types, or tags. Each folder contains solutions to problems, along with explanations and the thought process behind each solution.

### Example Structure:
- `arrays/` - Solutions and explanations for array-related problems.
- `strings/` - Solutions for string manipulation problems.
- `dynamic-programming/` - Problems and solutions involving dynamic programming techniques.
- `sorting/` - Various sorting algorithms and related challenges.

## About This Journey

Throughout this journey, I aim to:
- **Solve a variety of LeetCode problems:** From easy to hard, across multiple categories.
- **Document my progress:** Each solution includes comments and sometimes additional documentation explaining the approach.
- **Learn and apply new concepts:** As I encounter new concepts or techniques, I’ll make a note of them and apply them to relevant problems.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the folders and files. Each solution is written in Python. You can explore the problems and try solving them on your own before looking at the solutions.

### How to Contribute

If you have suggestions, improvements, or would like to contribute by adding more problems and solutions, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
